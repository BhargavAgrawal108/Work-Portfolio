## ðŸ‘‹ About Me  

Hey! Iâ€™m **Bhargav Agrawal** â€” a Finance professional by education and a data storyteller by passion.  
I love exploring how numbers can narrate business performance and guide smarter decisions.  

Currently working in **Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)**, I blend my finance background (B.Com, M.Com) with analytics tools like **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **DAX** to simplify complex data into meaningful insights.  

I also manage my own personal investments and have a keen interest in topics like **retirement planning**, **insurance**, and **wealth growth** â€” blending finance with real-life strategy.  
Outside of finance and dashboards, youâ€™ll find me experimenting in the **kitchen**  â€” cooking is my creative escape!

âœ¨ *Thanks for stopping by! Iâ€™m always open to collaborations, analytics discussions, and new learning opportunities.*

## Key Measures (Examples)
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM('Sales'[Revenue])
Total Profit = SUM('Sales'[Profit])
Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Revenue], 0)

MTD Revenue = TOTALMTD([Total Revenue], 'Date'[Date])
Previous Month Revenue = CALCULATE([Total Revenue], PREVIOUSMONTH('Date'[Date]))

Weekend Transactions = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('Sales'),
    FILTER('Sales', WEEKDAY('Sales'[Date], 2) >= 6)
)
